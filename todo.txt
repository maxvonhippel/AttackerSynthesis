it's a bit inconvenient to have the models in one directory and the properties in another. also properties are called "experiments", which seems strange. i would put the entire TCP example in one directory, and rename properties property1.pml, property2.pml, etc.

the tool is a bit too "silent" in that it generates the files in the out/ dir, but doesn't output any message in the console saying so.

also, the tool generates several auxiliary files like bla_daisy.pml, ... which it leaves it the ./ directory. i think this is not a good idea. either it should leave them in the out/ directory (which the user can just remove without worry) or it should delete them (cleanup) before it exits. it could be a tool option.

a bit of explanation of the livenessExamples1 and 2 would be nice to have (unless we plan to explain them / include them in the arxiv report, in which case it's ok to just wait and point to the report for explanations).

the tool gives an exception when the out/ dir is not present, perhaps it should just go ahead and create it?

there is some extra space in this message:
