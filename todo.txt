a bit of explanation of the livenessExamples1 and 2 would be nice to have (unless we plan to explain them / include them in the arxiv report, in which case it's ok to just wait and point to the report for explanations).
	+ do this in the form explainer.md as Cole did in smallDemos and then add links in the docs.
