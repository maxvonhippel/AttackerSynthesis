## Alice

Alice is a pirate.

Alice advertises & initiates her piracy by waving a 
pirate_flag.

She might attack a ship owned by the Royal Navy, which
would wave the royal_flag before clobbering her.

Alice cannot beat the Royal Navy but can beat everyone else.
Anyone else, Alice attacks until they wave the "I give 
up" flag white_flag.

## Bob

Bob is a fisherman.

Bob is rather clever, so whenever he sees Alice, he
gives up immediately.

This way Alice just takes his fish without killing him.

Bob owns the flags white_flag and royal_flag, 
and can recognize pirate_flag.
