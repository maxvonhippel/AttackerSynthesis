# Running the example
Run the following command: `python3 Korg.py --name='smallDemo2' --dir='./demo/smallDemo2/*'` in the top level directory.
Expect: `We could not find any (model, (N), phi)-attacker A.`
# P and Q 
P and Q are represented by the NFAs below. The Phi  is `G F w`, which can be read as always eventually `w = 1`. Just from looking at the diagrams below it should become apparant that this Phi might not be made true by P and Q. Study the diagrams and then read the explanation below.

# Explanation
This Phi cannot be made false given P and the IO interface of Q. The point of this example is to show the limits of the tool. Since the original Phi cannot be made true given P and Q, finding an attacker will be a trivial exercise because attackers typically invalidate a property that was once valid.
